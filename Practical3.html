	<h2> About Course </h2>

	<p> Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style sheet (CSS) and JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything form building a sample page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed by different web browsers, devices and screen sizes. </p>
